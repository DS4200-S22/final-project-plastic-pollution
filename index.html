  <h1>Abstract</h1>

  <p>
    Plastic pollution is a prevalent issue in todayâ€™s world as it has detrimental effects on the environment and marine life.
    We propose a visualization that would allow one to see the consumption of plastic by each country and continent as a whole.
    This visualization tool would fill a gap between not visually seeing what areas in the world are the most responsible for plastic pollution.
    It would help the average person be more aware of their habits when it comes to the disposal of plastic waste.
    Policymakers would benefit from seeing what proportion of plastic waste is insufficiently disposed of and littered worldwide.
    They can put the necessary regulations and policies worldwide to combat this issue.

  <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

  <p>
    This visualization tools intended use is to reveal and compare waste generation metrics on different scales. The <strong> Waste Generation </strong> tab reveals the waste generation per day on a country basis. A map visualization was chosen to effectively differentiate countries for the user and the use a color coded heatmap reveals the range of waste generation per day each country produces. Next, the grouped bar chart on the <strong> Mismanaged Waste </strong> displays the total mismanaged waste on a continent level for the year 2010 and their 2025 projections. The linked scatter plot on the other hand looks at mismanaged waste per person on a country level compared to each countries coastal population. These two tabs utilize brushing and linking to allow for the user to interact with the data to dive deeper into the visualizations. Lastly, the <strong> Economic Status and Daily Waste Generation </strong> tab aggregates each country into their economic status category and compares waste generation per day per person, while also displaying the percent of the sum of the rates. To summarize, this visualization tool allowed the user to look at continent totals, country totals, per person averages, and even economic status averages.
